# Changelog

All notable changes to PMAS are documented here. The project uses a single product name — **PMAS** — with no version suffixes in user-facing branding; internal versions are tracked here for development history.

## [Unreleased]

### Security hardening — audit follow-up (5 Oct 2026, maintainer round)
Follow-up to an independent source-first security audit of `522ba93`. Merged the contributor's
three verified PRs (#41 session revocation + account recovery, #43 research-export consent-gate
alignment, #44 sign-out clears the on-device record), then closed the remaining auth-hardening items:

- **Per-source rate limiting** (`source_throttle`, auto-created on deploy): register/login/activate
  are now capped per client address within a fixed window. The per-phone lockout alone could not
  stop phone-number enumeration or credential spraying across many accounts, or unauthenticated
  bcrypt CPU burn on register.
- **Constant-cost login/activation:** when an account is absent, one bcrypt comparison is still spent
  against a fixed decoy hash, so response timing no longer reveals whether a phone number is
  registered (previously ~11x slower for a known number).
- **Phone canonicalisation:** self-registration, pharmacist enrollment and admin-created staff store
  the number in one canonical 10-digit form, so the same number as `+91…` can no longer create a
  second account; all phone lookups match both forms for backward compatibility.
- **Container hardening:** the backend image now runs as an unprivileged user and ships a
  `.dockerignore`.
- **CI hardening:** GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs and `backend-ci.yml` declares
  `permissions: contents: read`.

Verified by execution on a SQLite shim with dummy principals: same-instant token survives 15/15,
pre-change token revoked, consent gate accepts genuine v2 consent and rejects forged records,
`+91` duplicate rejected, login timing ratio 1.04x, source limit trips. Backend suite 20/20, ruff clean.

## [Unreleased]

### Consent screen fixes (30 Sep 2026, maintainer round)
- **Fixed (regression from consent v2):** the Continue/Skip buttons and the in-screen language dropdown had ended up **outside** the consent screen container, so they stayed visible over every app section after consent — reported by the owner with screenshots. The DOM structure is rebuilt; verified by strict containment checks (buttons live inside `#consent-screen`, consent screen fully hides after Continue, no consent elements in any app tab).
- Removed the redundant language-selection dropdown below the checkboxes (the header selector already does this, works pre-consent, and persists the choice).
- Removed the "Skip — try the demo without an account" button: it duplicated Continue's behaviour. Dedicated login / sign-up / forgot-password screens are deferred design work; for the prototype a single Continue keeps the flow honest.
- Service worker bumped to `pmas-demo_v11`.

## [Unreleased]

### Consent UX v2 (30 Sep 2026, maintainer round — owner direction)
- The six granular consent checkboxes are replaced by a Google-style acknowledgment: **three checkboxes** (18+ age confirmation, agreement to the Privacy Policy & Terms of Use, research-prototype / not-medical-advice safety) after a plain-language bulleted summary of the study points. All six substantive points remain presented on-screen; the wording of every retained string is unchanged. The stored consent record now truthfully reflects the new UI (`ui_version: 2`, three booleans) and continues to sync to the server attestation unchanged.
- **Skip-login trial path:** an explicit "Skip — try the demo without an account" button on the consent screen (translated, all five languages). The three acknowledgements are still required — data is written locally from the first tap — but users now see clearly that no account is needed; a toast explains where cloud sync can be added later.
- Service worker bumped to `pmas-demo_v10`.

## [Unreleased]

### Patient-app demo fixes (30 Sep 2026, maintainer round)
- **Branding:** the app title said "PMAS" in English but "PMAS Lite" (transliterated) in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Hindi — a leftover from the demo's earliest days. All five languages now show "PMAS".
- **Install (PWA):** the demo manifest declared the invalid `"sizes": "any"` for a PNG icon and pointed its 192x192 maskable entry at the 512x512 favicon, which broke Chrome's installability criteria — the install banner never appeared. Icon entries corrected (same treatment as the platform manifest in #42); the install banner is now translated into all five languages, and iPhone/iPad users (where the automatic prompt never fires) get a "Share → Add to Home Screen" hint instead.
- **Consent UX:** a "Select all" toggle now sits above the six consent acknowledgements, so the common path is one tap instead of six. All six granular acknowledgements remain (unchanged wording — DPDP-relevant text untouched), translated in all five languages.
- **Language persistence (pre-consent):** a language chosen on the consent screen now survives reloads — previously it only persisted after consent was given, so an interrupted first visit fell back to English.
- Service worker bumped to `pmas-demo_v9` for the precached index.html/i18n.js/app.js changes.

## [Unreleased]

### External review collaboration — merged PRs (30 Sep 2026)
- **#26 (PR #36)** JWT secret import-order fix: `load_dotenv()` now runs before the `database`/`auth` imports, and the lifespan guard additionally rejects the public development secret value. Previously, with the documented `.env`-only setup, tokens were signed with the repo-committed fallback secret while the startup guard passed (critical, auth bypass). Regression-tested in the test suite below.
- **#30 (PR #37)** Contact-form validation errors now show a distinct red toast with `role="alert"` (assertive live region) and a longer display time — an empty-submit error can no longer be mistaken for a "message sent" confirmation on mobile. Maintainer follow-up bumped the platform service worker to `pmas-platform_v6`.
- **#28 (PR #38)** Dose dates are now keyed to a fixed clinical timezone (Asia/Kolkata) on both sides: a new `clinicalDateKey()` helper replaces UTC date keys at all 16 client call sites, and `clinical_today()` replaces `date.today()` at all 9 server call sites (recording guard, today/weekly summaries, dashboard, appointments, break-glass, study days, baselines). Doses taken 00:00–05:30 IST were previously attributed to the previous day — a data-quality defect for the primary HEOR outcome. Demo service worker bumped to `pmas-demo_v7`.
- **#34 (PR #39)** Backend CI on GitHub Actions (free tier): `ruff` lint + a 10-test pytest suite — health endpoint, auth primitives (bcrypt/JWT roundtrip, expiry), and subprocess regression tests for #26 that exercise `.env`-only JWT configuration in a clean process. `ruff.toml` documents every ignore (E402 is required by the #26 import ordering; E712 is idiomatic SQLAlchemy).
- Account-recovery RCA filed as issue #40 with PR #41 open (pharmacist-reissued activation codes + `token_valid_after` session revocation).

### Site improvements (this PR)
- **Social-share preview fixed:** `assets/images/og/og-image.png` is now a real 1200×630 card (dark theme, logo, PMAS wordmark) — every page's `og:image`/`twitter:image` meta tags already declared 1200×630, but the file was a 512×512 favicon, degrading WhatsApp/LinkedIn/X link previews.
- **Manifest icon accuracy:** the `192x192` entry pointed at the 512×512 favicon; a dedicated maskable 192×192 icon is added (`assets/images/icons/icon-192-maskable.png`, dark full-bleed with centered logo for the safe zone), and the invalid `"sizes": "any"` entry now declares `512x512`.
- Platform service worker bumped to `pmas-platform_v7` (precached `manifest.json` changed; also clears runtime-cached og-image for returning visitors).

### Self-review round (30 Sep 2026)
- **Backend hardening:** self-registration is now throttled with the same DB-backed mechanism as login/activation (register runs a bcrypt hash per call — an unthrottled endpoint was a cheap CPU-burn surface). Symptom logs reject future dates (same-day vitals; a future date would corrupt study-day calculation in the research export). All pydantic `.dict()` calls migrated to `.model_dump()` (v2 API).
- **Consent-screen accessibility (WCAG 2.2):** consent checkboxes enlarged 18px → 24px minimum target size, full-row 44px touch targets, larger consent text (0.95rem labels) for elderly/low-vision users — the one screen every patient must understand before using the app. Service worker cache bumped to `pmas-demo_v8` for the precached styles.css change.

### Resolved from external code review (issues #27–#35, 30 Sep 2026)
- **#27** Login/activation throttling is now database-backed (`throttle_states` table): limits survive restarts and are shared across workers; the in-process dicts (unbounded memory, per-worker, reset on restart) are gone. Same policy: 5 consecutive failures lock the phone for 15 minutes; success clears the row. Expired lockout rows are pruned on read, so the table self-cleans.
- **#29** Pharmacist dashboard adherence is now computed against expected dose slots from active medication plans (shared `expected_dose_slots` helper), not just logged doses — a patient who took 1 of 3 doses and logged only that one now reads 33%, not 100%.
- **31** Study IDs widened from 6 to 10 digits: at 6 digits the ~50% birthday-collision point is ~1.2k patients; 10 digits pushes it far beyond pilot scale.
- **32** Break-glass adherence history fetched with a single `dose_date BETWEEN` range query instead of one query per day (N+1); `backend/migrations/004_indexes.sql` adds the hot foreign-key indexes (run on live DB before deploy, same rule as 002/003).
- **33** `DELETE /api/v1/medications/{med_id}` now types the path parameter as UUID — non-UUID input is a 422, not an unhandled 500.
- **35** Community files added: CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, and issue templates (bug report / feature request), including the inbound-contribution licensing clause.


### Deployed — G10 consent-timestamp semantics (29 Sep 2026, after migrations/003)
- `patient_profiles.consent_timestamp` is now NULL from enrollment until the patient attests consent on their own device — the field means exactly "when consent occurred", never a placeholder. Previously enrollment wrote the enrollment time into a field named as the consent time while consent was still pending (audit finding G10, MEDIUM data-integrity).


### Deployed — governance implementation round (29 Sep 2026, G8/G9/G5)
- **G8 — patient-controlled credentials.** Enrollment no longer generates or returns a password. The pharmacist receives a one-time 6-digit activation code (valid 7 days); the patient activates the account on their own device ("Activate with code" in the patient app, translated in all 5 languages) and chooses their own password. The pharmacist never enters, receives, or sees the patient's password. Activation is throttled like login (5 failures → 15-minute lockout) and audit-logged (ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED). Unactivated accounts cannot log in (clear "not yet activated" message).
- **G9 — admin is governance, not clinical.** Enrollment and the pharmacist dashboard are now pharmacist-only. Admin reaches clinical data exclusively through the new break-glass route (`POST /api/v1/admin/break-glass`), which requires a written reason (min 10 chars), returns a single patient's summary, and persists the reason in the new `break_glass_access` table plus the audit trail with IP. No routine admin clinical access remains.
- **G5 — research export is consent-gated.** `/api/v1/research/export` now requires the patient's attested research consent (`consent_status=True` plus the full acknowledgement set from the §4A attestation). Authentication is not authorization; audit logging is not authorization.
- Schema notes: new tables `pending_activations` and `break_glass_access` are auto-created on deploy (no manual SQL needed). **Staged for after migrations/003 runs on the live database: G10 (consent-timestamp nullability).**


### Deployed — audit remediation round 2 (28 Sep 2026)
- **Per-pharmacist dashboard scoping** (`patient_profiles.enrolled_by`): every dashboard statistic and the recent-patients list are now limited to patients the calling pharmacist personally enrolled. Admins see only patients they enrolled themselves (admin is governance, not clinical superuser). Self-registered patients remain invisible to pharmacists until enrolled. Prerequisite migration `002_enrolled_by.sql` was run on the live database before this deploy.
- Patients enrolled before this change have no `enrolled_by` owner recorded and will not appear in any pharmacist's worklist until re-enrolled.


### Fixed — audit remediation round 1 (28 Sep 2026)
- **Patient adherence now actually syncs.** Offline-first records previously carried local medication IDs that the server rejected (silent 422s behind a success toast — the server never received any dose). Medications are now created/mapped server-side on first sync, and adherence records sync with change detection. Sync failures are now surfaced to the patient instead of being swallowed.
- **Enrolled patients can now log in.** Enrollment returns a one-time temporary password to the pharmacist (portal displays + copies it); patients change it at first login via the new change-password endpoint and patient-app control (5 languages). Previously the generated password was discarded and the account was unreachable.
- **Symptom duplicates eliminated.** Each symptom entry syncs exactly once (synced-state tracking); previously every reconnect re-uploaded the entire log.
- **Cross-patient adherence injection blocked** (medication ownership is validated server-side).
- **Weekly adherence no longer crashes on days 1–6 of a month** (date arithmetic bug).
- **Login throttling**: accounts lock for 15 minutes after 5 failed attempts.
- **XSS hardened**: patient names in the pharmacist portal and emergency-contact fields in the Health Summary are escaped before rendering.
- **Enrollment consent model (§4A)**: enrollment no longer auto-marks consent; the patient consents on-device and the app attests the record (checks, timestamp, version) on first sync.
- **Configuration guard**: the backend refuses to start without `JWT_SECRET`, without an explicit CORS allow-list, or with a wildcard origin. `python-dotenv` is now loaded so local `.env` files work.
- **Audit trail extended**: dashboard views, research exports, password changes and profile/consent attestations are now logged, with client IP captured on privileged events.
- **Validation tightened**: patient passwords ≥ 8 chars; medication end-date ≥ start-date; at least one dose slot required; time format checks; no far-future dose dates; API profile payloads no longer require explicit nulls (Pydantic v2 `Optional` default fix).
- **Health endpoint** now reports `privacy_posture: "dpdp_aligned_design"` instead of an unverifiable `dpdp_compliant: true`.
- Housekeeping: unused `psycopg2-binary` dependency and dead `require_role` helper removed; deprecated `datetime.utcnow`/`on_event` replaced; appointments sort ascending; service worker caches bumped to v5; homepage "never transmitted" claim corrected; `pmas_portal_api_url` isolates portal storage from the patient app.
- Staged (needs a one-time SQL migration on the live database before deploy): per-pharmacist dashboard scoping via `patient_profiles.enrolled_by` — see `backend/migrations/002_enrolled_by.sql`.


### Deployed
- **PMAS is live end-to-end (27 Sep 2026)** — platform + patient app on GitHub Pages, backend API on Render, PostgreSQL on Supabase (Mumbai), all free tier. Live URLs in `docs/09-deployment.md`.
- First live patient-loop verification from a mobile device on the deployed app: account registration → medication plan → dose logged → sign-in and symptom sync confirmed. (The 28 Sep audit later found adherence records were silently failing to sync — fixed in the remediation round above.)
- Deploy fixes: backend Docker image binds to Render's `PORT`; `requirements.txt` lists PyJWT (was: unused python-jose, which broke the clean-environment build).
- Known limitation: the free-tier API sleeps after ~15 min idle — the first request takes ~30–60 s (the patient app remains fully usable offline).

### Security
- **Privacy disclosure updated for optional cloud sync (DPDP-aligned)** — privacy page now accurately states offline-by-default with opt-in sync, names the hosting services involved (GitHub Pages, Render, Supabase Mumbai region), adds an adults-only (18+) account confirmation in all 5 languages, and a grievance channel via the contact page. Homepage/about/README claims updated to match.
- **Self-registration is now patient-only.** The register endpoint no longer accepts a client-supplied role, closing a privilege-escalation path (previously anyone could POST `role: "pharmacist"` or `"admin"`).
- New admin account-governance API — list users, create staff accounts, change roles, suspend/reactivate — administrator-only and audit-logged. Admins cannot change their own role or status.
- First-run administrator bootstrap via `ADMIN_PHONE` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables.
- Pharmacist portal: staff self-registration removed; patient accounts are created in the patient app.

### Changed
- Project reframed as an **independent telepharmacy research project by Kartik H** — institutional affiliations, dissertation framing and third-party references removed across docs, marketing pages, consent screens and app strings (all 5 languages).
- Product model formalised in the PRD: the 90-day telepharmacy care loop for rural and remote chronic-care patients.

### Added
- Product Requirements Document: `docs/00-product-requirements.md` (problem statement, personas, scope, functional & non-functional requirements, success metrics, risks).
- Architecture Decision Record: `docs/adr/ADR-001` — clinical scope and diagnostic boundary (why PMAS excludes diagnostic/prediction features; the AI boundary).
- This repository: consolidated project structure (`patient-app/`, `backend/`, `pharmacist-portal/`, `docs/`).
- Complete documentation set: vision, architecture, data model, security/DPDP mapping, HEOR research design, multilingual content model, AI integration strategy, roadmap, deployment, funding & business, AI-usage disclosure.
- API sync layer (`demo/js/api.js`) added to the patient app source (wiring into the app shell is next — see roadmap).

## History (pre-repository)

### Platform v3 — PWA + AI-era layer
- Installable PWA demo with offline service worker and install prompt.
- AI-crawler/AI-era web layer: `llms.txt`, JSON-LD, canonical URLs, Open Graph / Twitter cards, robots directives.

### v1.1 feature review (all 10 items implemented)
- Adherence tracking (taken / delayed / missed, per-slot).
- Granular, per-purpose consent capture.
- Study ID + de-identified export path.
- Safety escalation redesign for symptom red flags.
- Complete 5-language translations (English, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Hindi).
- Local medication reminders (in-app + browser notifications).
- Patient PDF report.
- Fixed next-due logic and appointment sorting.
- Removed `user-scalable=no` (accessibility fix).

### v1.0 — original prototype
- Single-file offline-first demo (early prototype): consent, profile, medications, dose logging, symptom logging, multilingual UI.
- One-page research concept note (study design, outcomes, population, ethics pathway).

### Branding
- Hexagon-cube logo adopted as the brand icon across the platform; all "Lite" and version suffixes removed from naming — the product is **PMAS**, full stop.
